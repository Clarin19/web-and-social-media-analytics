An assessment into visitor data clickstream analysis as part of individual submission

Imagine you are applying for the position of Business Analyst in Scotland's largest touring
company, HaggisBus. As part of the application process, you are asked to create a onepage report to demonstrate your knowledge of the subject and originality of your approach.

HaggisBus has provided you with a dataset (visitor_data_clickstream.csv) that contains web
traffic data (click stream) from 160,000 visitors to their website while the company has run
three advertisement campaigns (on LinkedIn, Facebook and on Partner websites). Data
includes the click stream (list of all pages that each user visited, in order) and user's
information: origin and platform.

Origin can have a value "linkedin_advert", "facebook_advert", "partner_advert" to indicate
which advert was clicked to open the website; or "linkedin_share", "facebook_share" if
someone clicked a post shared by their friend (not a paid advert); or 'direct' for users that
typed the URL themselves; or 'search' for those who came to the website via search engine.
Platform indicates the type of device they used: 'mac', 'windows', 'ios', 'android' or 'unknown'
(unknown device means that for various reasons, the platform could not be established, e.g.
because of "ad blocker", or because this was a scraping attempt).

Comment on the effectiveness of the three advertisement campaigns by calculating the most
appropriate web analytics measures and presenting them in ways you see as most
appropriate.

➢ Do the three campaigns perform differently, and what could these differences mean?
What measurements did you use to measure each campaign’s performance?

➢ Do the users from different platforms behave differently? There were concerns that
some platforms struggled at a particular stage of the process, can you find these
stages?

➢ How does performance of users coming via adverts compare with those that came
via social media shares? How about those who came to the site directly, or via
search engine?

➢ Which blog converts better? (so that you know you should write more of similar ones
in the future)

➢ Make sure that if you mention a measure (e.g. bounce rate), you also explain it in
your own words somewhere in your report (perhaps in a designated glossary
section).
